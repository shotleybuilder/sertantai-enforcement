  # Background: Each test case uses multiple DB connections (main process + Sandbox.allow for async operations)
  # This prevents "connection not available" errors and connection pool exhaustion

  # 2 minutes - necessary for dashboard metric calculations and large data operations

  # Or exclude heavy: mix test --exclude heavy

# Each test runs in a transaction that's rolled back after completion
