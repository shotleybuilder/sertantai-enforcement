End the current development session by:

1. Git commit the changes made during the session
2. If session exists, append a comprehensive summary including:
   - Session duration
   - Git summary:
     * Total files changed (added/modified/deleted)
     * List all changed files with change type
     * Number of commits made (if any)
     * Final git status
   - Todo summary:
     * Total tasks completed/remaining
     * List all completed tasks
     * List any incomplete tasks with status
   - Key accomplishments
   - All features implemented
   - Problems encountered and solutions
   - Breaking changes or important findings
   - Dependencies added/removed
   - Configuration changes
   - Deployment steps taken
   - Lessons learned
   - What wasn't completed
   - Tips for future developers

The summary should be thorough enough that another developer (or AI) can understand everything that happened without reading the entire session.
