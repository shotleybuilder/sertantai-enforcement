Start a new development session by creating a session file in `.claude/sessions/` with the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-$ARGUMENTS.md` (or just `YYYY-MM-DD.md` if no session name provided).  Use system date.

The session file should begin with:
1. Session name as the title
2. Filename of the session file
3. Session overview section with start time
4. Goals section (ask user for goals if not clear)
5. Empty progress section ready for updates
