  # This file contains patterns to ignore specific Dialyzer warnings.
  # Patterns can be:
  # - Regular expressions: ~r"pattern"
  # - Tuples: {"file_pattern", :warning_type, ~c"message_pattern"}
  #
  # Run `mix dialyzer --list-unused-filters` to see which filters are not being used.
  # Keep this file minimal - only add filters for known false positives.
